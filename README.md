# New kind of consumer social app built my Mark B. and Oscar T-S. 

This app embraces trends in authenticity and disconnecting from the endless digital scrolling of the 2020s. 
When pokemon Go came out, I would meet people randomly on the street who were also playing the game and was able to strike a conversationsomething nearly impossible in Munich, Germany usually and impossible for myself anywhere.
This made me aware of software's ability to bring people together way more than any other social media app because it encouraged me to talk to real people.
Anyway, I wanted to build an app that wouldn't be a game, that created spontaneous interaction in public places and that isn't a dating app or some
subscription based gizmo. No features that detract from the ability of social media to bring people together - unlike snapchat etc. where you have all of this unnecessary data that just gives you a headache.
Also, maybe we monetize this later by letting restaurants advertise themselves - so many empty restaurants.
